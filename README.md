# MSEndpointManager
Intune/Endpoint Manager enrollment debugging tool
Intune Debug Toolkit is a community developed solution, maintained by Mattias Melkersen from MSEndpointMgr including community members Oliver Kieselbach (@okieselb), Rudy Ooms (@Mister_MDM) and David Just (@DavidJu14353759), Jannik Reinhard (@jannik_reinhard), Ondrej Å ebela (@AndrewZtrhgf), David Segura (@SeguraOSD) and Petri Paavola (@petripaavola) aiming at providing better and easier debug possibilities on devices co-managed or Intune managed only.

The intent of this repo is to maintain an actvice copy of the work provided by the community with full credit given to the people who got it this far.  Further development here will be my fork of this project with links to their effort provided as well.
